# Glucose prediction and insulin recommendation

## Problem description

This project aims to predict glucose levels and recommend insulin doses for patients with type 2 diabetes. The data used in this project is collected from the Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University. The data includes the patient's time series features including: glucose levels, insulin doses, and other drag usages, and static features including: age, gender, height, weight, BMI, and other clinical features.

In next step, we will incorporate the patient's data from other hospitals to improve the model's generalization ability by using federated learning.
